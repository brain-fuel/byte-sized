### Unsubscription
Rationale: I want people to feel free to say "no", and so I want the unsubscription process to be as easy as possible. I want to earn your subscription and if I don't, I don't want to clutter up your time with something you find useless.

- Page for Confirmation "You will get an email confirming unsubscription. This is to keep someone else from unsubscribing you without your approval."

If you didn't make this request, you don't need to do anything - you'll continue receiving the newsletter as usual.

Thank you for giving us a try!
