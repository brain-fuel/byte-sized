# Byte-Sized Brain Fuel

## A Quick Word from {{ Dad | Matt }}

Welcome to Byte-Sized Brain Fuel! This is a daily exploration of ideas that matter - from code to philosophy, from theology to technology. Each day, I select insights from across different domains of human knowledge, not to overwhelm but to illuminate where ideas meet and multiply.

Think of this as your daily intellectual espresso shot - concentrated, carefully crafted, and designed to energize your thinking. I read widely and share selectively, mapping the vast territory of ideas while highlighting the paths I find most worthy of exploration.

I believe the most interesting discoveries happen at the intersections. A theological insight might inform your coding practices, or a scientific principle might reshape your social understanding. That's what Brain Fuel is about - making these connections visible, one byte at a time.

Let's explore together.

## Epoch

e·poch (ee-pok)
noun

1. A significant period or era marked by particular characteristics or events
2. A reference point from which time is measured
3. In computing, a specific date and time from which a computer counts elapsed time (often January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)

From Greek 'epochē', meaning "pause, cessation, fixed point"

The concept of an epoch appears across many fields: geologists discuss geological epochs, astronomers use the J2000 epoch for celestial coordinates, and every Unix-like computer counts seconds from its epoch to track time. In each case, an epoch serves as a fixed point that gives meaning to what follows.

As we begin 2025, we're marking our own small epoch - a reference point for the journey ahead.

## How Computers Store Text

Every piece of text you see on a computer - from tweets to novels - is ultimately stored as numbers. When you type "Hello", your computer stores it as a sequence of numbers using a system called ASCII or Unicode.

For example, the letter 'A' is stored as the number 65. 'B' is 66, and so on. This system lets computers work with text while only really understanding numbers.

Next time you see text on a screen, remember: you're looking at a sophisticated translation of numbers into letters that humans can read.

## First Principles: Primitives

Throughout 2025, we'll build a foundation for understanding software from the ground up. Whether you're an experienced engineer looking to revisit fundamentals with fresh eyes, or someone curious about how software really works, I invite you to join this exploration of computing's basic building blocks and how they combine to create the complex systems we use every day.

We start with primitives - the atomic units of information in our programs. For experienced developers, consider how these fundamentals shape the abstractions you work with daily. For those new to programming, these are the first tools you'll use to build anything in code.

When we build programs, we start with basic pieces of information. Just like you might describe something using numbers or words, computers need basic ways to represent data.

In Go, we have a few fundamental types:

Text (called "strings")
```go
name := "Dinglydoof"
```

Whole numbers (called "integers")
```go
count := 42
```

Decimal numbers (called "floating point")
```go
temperatureInFahrenheit := 98.6
```

True/False values (called "booleans")
```go
isActive := true
```

If you want to play around and run these examples and more, I've put them for you here on [The Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/ONcatUXB1rE)

These are called "primitives" because they're our basic building blocks. We can't break them down any further, but we can use them to build more complex things. You can think of them like atoms in chemistry: they're the fundamental pieces we combine to make everything else. Next time, we'll look at how to combine these primitive pieces to do calculations and represent more complex information.

## Act and Potency (1/26)

When we make New Year's resolutions, we're engaging with one of philosophy's most fundamental distinctions: the difference between what is and what could be. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle, called these "act" (what something is right now) and "potency" (what something could become).

A seed is actually a seed, but potentially a tree. A student is actually learning, but potentially a master. Every change involves something moving from potency to act - from what could be to what is.

This isn't just abstract philosophy. When we write code, design systems, or plan our lives, we're always working with both what is (act) and what could be (potency). The art lies in seeing both clearly.

As Wuellner notes in his Summary of Scholastic Principles, "Potency and act constitute a complete and fundamental division of being and of every order of being" (Wuellner, 1956)

## Jesus: The Name Above All Names

On the eighth day of Christmas, Jesus received his name - a name that, as St. Paul writes, is "above every name" (Philippians 2:9). This wasn't just a cultural formality; in Hebrew tradition, names carry real power and meaning. The name Jesus (Yeshua) means "YHWH saves" - it's both identity and mission wrapped together.

We understand that this naming ceremony, combined with Christ's circumcision, marks His first blood shed for us in perfect fulfillment of the Law of God - the beginning of a life lived perfectly under the Law for our sake. It's fitting that the Church year places this feast on January 1st, where the secular world marks new beginnings.

Like the primitive types we build our programs from, or the fundamental concepts that shape our thinking, this Name forms one of the basic building blocks of our faith - a foundation from which everything else flows.

## The Heartbeat of Atoms

The most precise clocks in the world don't tick with gears or crystals - they count the oscillations of atoms. Specifically, cesium atoms naturally vibrate 9,192,631,770 times per second. This isn't an arbitrary number; it's how we define one second.

These atomic clocks are so precise that they would only lose one second if they ran for 100 million years. This precision matters: GPS satellites use atomic time to calculate your position, and the internet uses it to keep data centers synchronized across the globe.

We've turned one of nature's most consistent behaviors into a fundamental unit of measurement, showing how understanding the smallest things can help us manage the largest systems.

## A World of New Years

While much of the world follows the Gregorian calendar and celebrates the new year on January 1st, human societies show remarkable diversity in how they mark time's passing. Chinese New Year follows lunar cycles, the Islamic New Year both follows lunar cycles and shifts through the seasons, and the Jewish Rosh Hashanah commemorates creation itself.

*How are they different?* These different ways of marking time aren't just calendar variations - they reflect profound differences in how cultures understand cycles, renewal, and human relationship with time. Some mark agricultural cycles, others astronomical events, and still others historical or religious moments.

*How are they similar?* All of them exemplify the human need to find meaning in beginnings and endings, to mark moments of transition, and to see time as more than just passing seconds.

## Proverbs 1:7

"The fear of YHWH is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction."
*Proverbs 1:7*

Like the primitive types that form the foundation of our programs, or the fundamental particles that make up matter, fear of God forms the basis of true knowledge. As we begin this journey together, we acknowledge Him as the source of all Wisdom.
