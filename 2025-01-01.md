# Byte-Sized Brain Fuel

## A Quick Word from Matt

Welcome to Byte-Sized Brain Fuel! This is a daily exploration of ideas that matter - from code to philosophy, from theology to technology. Each day, I select insights from across different domains of human knowledge, not to overwhelm but to illuminate where ideas meet and multiply.

Think of this as your daily intellectual espresso shot - concentrated, carefully crafted, and designed to energize your thinking. I read widely and share selectively, mapping the vast territory of ideas while highlighting the paths I find most worthy of exploration.

I believe the most interesting discoveries happen at the intersections. A theological insight might inform your coding practices, or a scientific principle might reshape your social understanding. That's what Brain Fuel is about - making these connections visible, one byte at a time.

Let's explore together.

Matt

## Epoch

e·poch (ee-pok)
noun

1. A significant period or era marked by particular characteristics or events
2. A reference point from which time is measured
3. In computing, a specific date and time from which a computer counts elapsed time (often January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC)

From Greek 'epochē', meaning "pause, cessation, fixed point"

The concept of an epoch appears across many fields: geologists discuss geological epochs, astronomers use the J2000 epoch for celestial coordinates, and every Unix-like computer counts seconds from its epoch to track time. In each case, an epoch serves as a fixed point that gives meaning to what follows.

As we begin 2025, we're marking our own small epoch - a reference point for the journey ahead.

## How Computers Store Text

Every piece of text you see on a computer - from tweets to novels - is ultimately stored as numbers. When you type "Hello", your computer stores it as a sequence of numbers using a system called ASCII or Unicode.

For example, the letter 'A' is stored as the number 65. 'B' is 66, and so on. This system lets computers work with text while only really understanding numbers.

Next time you see text on a screen, remember: you're looking at a sophisticated translation of numbers into letters that humans can read.

If you want to see a list of all the Unicode characters, you can find them at [this link](https://www.charset.org/utf-8).

## First Principles: Primitives

Throughout 2025, we'll build a foundation for understanding software from the ground up. Whether you're an experienced engineer looking to revisit fundamentals with fresh eyes, or someone curious about how software really works, I invite you to join this exploration of computing's basic building blocks and how they combine to create the complex systems we use every day.

We start with primitives - the atomic units of information in our programs. For experienced developers, consider how these fundamentals shape the abstractions you work with daily. For those new to programming, these are the first tools you'll use to build anything in code.

When we build programs, we start with basic pieces of information. Just like you might describe something using numbers or words, computers need basic ways to represent data.

In Go, we have a few fundamental types:

Text (called "strings")
```go
name := "Hello"
```

Whole numbers (called "integers")
```go
count := 42
```

Decimal numbers (called "floating point")
```go
temperatureInFahrenheit := 98.6
```

True/False values (called "booleans")
```go
isActive := True
```

These are called "primitives" because they're our basic building blocks. We can't break them down any further, but we can use them to build more complex things. You can think of them like atoms in chemistry: they're the fundamental pieces we combine to make everything else. Next time, we'll look at how to combine these primitive pieces to do calculations and represent more complex information.
